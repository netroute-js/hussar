### Vocabulary

---

This section presents the **key terminologies and concepts** that are fundamental for understanding and using the Hussar testing framework.

> **Hussar Application**
> 
> The term **application under test (AUT)** refers to the specific software system or module being evaluated within a testing environment. In other words, that could be your Spring Boot application, etc.
>
> **[See supported applications](#applications).**
---
> **Hussar Extension**
>
> The term **testing framework extension** refers to an augmentation or enhancement of a core testing framework. It glues the testing framework and Hussar together. For example, a JUnit5 extension.
> 
> **[See supported extensions](#extensions).**
---
> **Hussar Service**
>
> In many cases, the **application under test (AUT)** requires integration with external services or components to simulate real-world operational environments. These services may include mock servers, databases, or third-party APIs, which are essential for validating the application's behavior under various conditions. For instance, **WireMock** can be used to simulate HTTP-based services, allowing controlled testing of external dependencies, while a **MySQL** database may serve as the backend persistence layer. Proper integration with these services ensures that the testing environment accurately reflects production scenarios, allowing for comprehensive validation of the application's functionality and robustness.
>
> **[See supported services](#services).**
---
> **Hussar Environment**
>
> To execute the test suites, a single critical component must be configuredâ€”**Hussar Environment**. This environment encapsulates the necessary infrastructure and configurations required to run the tests effectively. It consists of the following key elements:
> 
> - **Hussar Application**
> - **Hussar Services**
> - **Hussar Configurations** (e.g., properties, environment variables)
> 
> Proper configuration of these features ensures a cohesive and fully operational testing environment, essential for executing comprehensive test suites.

### Examples

---

This section provides a comprehensive collection of **examples** demonstrating the application of various **Hussar components** to expedite the configuration of your testing environment. Each example is designed to illustrate best practices and effective strategies for integrating Hussar components into your testing workflow. By leveraging these examples, you can quickly establish a robust and functional testing environment, optimizing setup time and ensuring adherence to standardized testing protocols. Detailed usage scenarios and configuration snippets are provided to facilitate seamless implementation and integration.

> **JUnit5 & Spring Boot** <a id="junit5-springboot-basic-example"/>
>
> Let's say that you want to use Hussar to test your Spring Boot application using JUnit5 testing framework. You will need the following Hussar components:
> - pl.netroute:hussar-core
> - pl.netroute:hussar-spring-boot-application
> - pl.netroute:hussar-junit5-extension
>
> This is the Spring Boot application that we want to test:
>
>```java@SpringBootApplication
>public class SimpleSpringApplication {
>
>    public static void main(String[] args) {
>        SpringApplication.run(SimpleSpringApplication.class, args);
>    }
>
>    @RestController
>    @RequestMapping("/api/v1")
>    public static class DefaultController {
>
>        @GetMapping("/ping")
>        public ResponseEntity<String> ping() {
>            return ResponseEntity.ok("pong");
>        }
>
>    }
>}
>```
>
> The next step is to create a JUnit5 test class: 
>
>```java
>@ExtendWith(HussarJUnit5Extension.class) // it glues Hussar and JUnit5 together. It's basically everything you need to make them work together
>@HussarEnvironment(configurerProvider = TestEnvironmentConfigurerProvider.class) // it provides Hussar tests environment configuration
>public class HussarJUnit5IT {
>    
>    @HussarApplication // it injects the Hussar's application
>    private Application application;
>
>    // you can use application's object method to get the physical endpoint - i.e. EndpointHelper.getAnyEndpointOrFail(application)
>
>    // test methods
>    
>}
>```
>
> See [Reference Hussar Application](#reference-hussar-application-example) section for more details about referencing Hussar's application in test classes. 
>
> It's time to go to the next critical component - **TestEnvironmentConfigurerProvider**:
>
>```java
>public class TestEnvironmentConfigurerProvider implements EnvironmentConfigurerProvider { // to provide Hussar's tests environment configuration, you need to implement this interface
>  
>    @Override
>    public LocalEnvironmentConfigurer provide() { // to provide Hussar's tests environment, you need to implement this method and provide the setup you wish to have
>        var application = SpringApplication.newApplication(SimpleSpringApplication.class); // in our example, we want to test SpringBoot application
>
>        return LocalEnvironmentConfigurer
>                .newInstance()
>                .withApplication(application) // it adds the SpringBoot application to the environment configuration
>                .done();
>    }
>

> This is all you need to configure to have **Hussar / Junit5 / Spring Boot** combination.

>
> As you can see it's quite easy to obtain a reference to the application that is being tested. It's enough to use **@HussarApplication** and then Hussar should inject the application object into your test class.

>
> There are two possible ways of referencing configured service:
> - Using **@HussarService** on top of a concrete field. It's type based injection. It can be used only if there is a single service of that type configured in the environment.
> - Using **@HussarService(name = <some-service-name>)** on top of concrete field. It's name based injection. It shall be used when there are more services configured for a given type in the environment.

>```java

>}
>
>public class SecondJUnit5IT extends BaseIT { // it extends the BaseIT, so it inherits the whole configuration
